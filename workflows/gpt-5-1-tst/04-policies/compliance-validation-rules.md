Insurance currency, title endorsement status, permits:

1. If there are any insurance certificates included as a part of the draw documentation, review that the expiration date is not before the expected funding date (10 days or less from today's date). Flag any near expiration dates as a warning.

2. Confirm building permits haven't expired or been suspended. If a permit renewal is needed, a new permit should be added as a part of a draw package. Flag any expired or suspended permits as warnings.
